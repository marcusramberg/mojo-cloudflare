DESCRIPTION
    Mojo::Cloudflare is an async client for the CloudFlare API
    <http://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html>.

SYNOPSIS
      use Mojo::Cloudflare;
      my $cf = Mojo::Cloudflare->new(
                 email => 'sample@example.com',
                 key => '8afbe6dea02407989af4dd4c97bb6e25',
                 zone => 'example.com',
               );

      for my $record (@{ $cf->records("all")->get("/objs") }) {
        warn $record->{zone_name};
    
        $cf->edit_record({
          id => $record->{rec_id},
          type => 'CNAME',
          name => 'home',
          content => 'example.com',
          ttl => 1,
          service_mode => 0,
        });
      }

ATTRIBUTES
  api_url
    Holds the endpoint where we communicate. Default is

  email
      $str = $self->email;
      $self = $self->email($str);

    The e-mail address associated with the API key.

  key
      $str = $self->key;
      $self = $self->key($str);

    This is the API key made available on your Account page.

  zone

METHODS
  add_record

              # ...
            });

    Used to add a new DNS record. $err is true and contains a string on
    error, while $json is a Mojo::JSON::Pointer object with the "rec" part
    from the JSON on success:

      {
        "request" => { ... },
        "response" => {
          "rec" => { # <== this structure

            },
          },
        },
        "result": ...,
